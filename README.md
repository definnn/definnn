- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @definnn or also rashdan and this is my personal/work repo.
- Not a great coder, but theres no bug that cant be fixed if google is still up.

Im a junior software developer who is growing and learning new technologies with my best friend Google and Youtube.
Nothing much here just old code and some private repo for clients, but will do post some personal projects for people to gawk at my spaghetti code.
Currently mainly utilizing PHP,js,html in Laravel for client projects, but is doing simple side projects using ReactJs in AWS (ElasticBeanstalk,Amplify) to create simple static 
web app and crud ones to utilize AWS services.
